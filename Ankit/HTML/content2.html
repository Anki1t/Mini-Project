        <p>residues that have lost their qualification as waste after recovery operations and can be reintroduced into
            the production process. It is a question of strengthening the implementation of the principle of resource
            recycling or reuse, which liesdo you think at the heart of the concept of a “circular economy.”

            Households and businesses are more willing to pay for the use of durable goods rather than buy them. Thanks
            to digital technologies and new designs, products today can be maintained efficiently, allowing for their
            life cycle to be extended. Regulatory restrictions on pollution and waste as they apply to products
            throughout the entire life cycle make resource reuse highly beneficial.

            The reuse of secondary raw materials has a threefold advantage. It allows for achieving (i) greater security
            in the supply of materials (in the face of constantly growing demand); (ii) a cleaner and healthier
            environment (due to the lower pressures of the extraction of natural resources and the reduction in the
            generation of waste); and (iii) savings on the purchase of raw materials, which may then lead to lower and
            less rapidly growing final prices.

            A few years ago, a well-known report on the circular economy in Europe (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2015)
            estimated that by implementing the principles of the circular economy, by 2050 Europe could improve its
            productivity by up to 3%, creating the conditions for containing price growth on the supply side and
            supporting economic growth. By 2030, the improvement in productivity would generate cost savings of up to
            600 billion euros per year (consider, for example, the construction sector, with construction costs that
            could be halved, or the mobility sector, where costs could be reduced by 75%) and an increase in gross
            domestic product of up to seven percentage points higher compared to the baseline.

            Strong commitments are needed
            Achieving these results today is essential. The New Circular Economy Action Plan (European Commission 2020),
            approved by the European Parliament in 2021, can mark a decisive step toward the adoption of a circular
            production model. It would provide significant savings, notably in areas where the pressure on prices is
            most intense: electronics, batteries and vehicles, packaging, plastics, textiles, building, food, water, and
            nutrients.

            It will be necessary to intervene in critical areas:

            The absence of European standards in the field of circular economy, which entails uncertainties about the
            quality of secondary raw materials and makes it difficult to verify the levels of impurities and
            sustainability of high degrees of recycling.
            The heterogeneity of national regulations, which, together with high transport costs, hinders the exchange
            of secondary raw materials between European countries, preventing their marketing and circulation in the
            European Union.
            The inadequacy of incentives for the use of recycled materials in products and infrastructures, which
            weakens the demand for secondary raw materials and prevents the development of a market.
            Still more is needed. Considering that to date 66% of industrial carbon dioxide emissions are caused by the
            production of steel, plastic, aluminium, and cement (figure 2), a significant reduction of these emissions
            will require intensifying the recycling of these materials and increasing the recourse to eco-design to
            obtain "removable" materials. This will permit the achievement of a rate of recovery that would otherwise be
            impossible to attain (although, of course, any recovery necessarily implies energy costs and carbon dioxide
            emissions, no matter how efficient it is). Recycling plants will have to be established and the process of
            "industrial symbiosis” will have to be promoted (inter alia, through the creation of circular production
            districts), whereby the waste produced by companies would be valued as raw materials to be employed by other
            companies.

            Policy considerations
            Implementing the principles of a circular economy will have direct and indirect beneficial effects on the
            ecological transition, mitigating the inflationary tensions that the transition will inevitably engender and
            which would hinder the transition in turn. Nonetheless, these effects will be observed only once the
            transition has been accomplished; meanwhile, significant costs will hit the economies and societies.

            This is why central banks have an important role to play in promoting these principles . Much as many
            central banks are growingly active, today, in mainstreaming green finance within their national financial
            sector strategies and policies,1 they can greatly contribute to the understanding of both the economic
            impact of circular businesses and the risks related to linear economy practices . Importantly, they should
            encourage the financial system to support projects involving the circular economy.

            Since all these actions will take time to produce positive effects, redistributive fiscal policies (which,
            on one side, would take from those who benefit from inflation and, on the other, would compensate those who
            are penalized by it), in combination with the European mechanisms for a “just transition”, will constitute
            indispensable tools to guarantee a faster transition that will leave no one behind.2

            To address the social and economic imbalances that are already being experienced and clearly rising, the use
            of such tools will need to be incisive and timely.
