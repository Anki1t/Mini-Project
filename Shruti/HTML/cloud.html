        <h2>What is full stack web development?</h2>
        <p><strong>Full stack development</strong> refers to web development taking place in both the front and back ends of a website. In other words, the process may involve a combination of underlying database work, user-facing website construction, and client-focused communication aimed at the planning and maintenance of projects (among many other responsibilities).
        Understanding the Role of Full Stack Developers
        Full stack developers merge front end and back end web development skills, tackling a wide variety of tasks in building and maintaining a digital entity (e.g., app, web page). The position is predicated upon versatility, innovative thinking, and a blend of technical programming knowledge and high-level client communication.
        Before they can apply their diverse skill set, however, aspiring full stack developers must first learn the distinction between front end and back end development, becoming versed in both fields to properly balance their array of responsibilities:
        </p>
        <h2>Front end development</h2>
        <p>Front end developers are responsible for a website or application’s user-facing elements. These may include aspects of the site’s user interface (UI), browser compatibility, and overall visual presentation. In other words, these developers create everything a user sees and experiences when navigating a site or app. Front end development tends to utilize programming languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make projects more engaging and interactive.
            </p>
        <h2>Back end development</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, back end developers maintain the website or application’s digital foundation. Think of them as a stage crew working behind the scenes of a concert. Back end developers oversee crucial underlying components that help define the site’s front end presentation and usability — such as database maintenance and debugging. They also work with front end developers to run usability testing and shore up foundational code as needed.
            </p>

        <h2>Back End vs. Front End Development</h2>
         <p>Back end developers work within a website or application’s underlying digital framework — they maintain databases, write and debug foundational code, and address factors contributing to speed and efficiency. Meanwhile, front end developers oversee a digital entity’s client-facing properties, including its user interface (UI), browser compatibility, and overall aesthetic presentation.
            </p>

        <h2>Typical Job Description of Full Stack Developers</h2>
        <p>Because they have proficiency working with both sides of development, full stack developers handle quite a bit of responsibility in a site or application’s cohesive development and maintenance. Indeed offers a comprehensive job description for the full stack developer role, which includes duties like:
            
         <br> Testing changes made to previously developed programs. 
         <br>Managing the full life cycle of software or applications, from initial conception to launch.
         <br>Upgrading and fine-tuning software and applications beyond their deployment.
         <br>Compiling feedback for site managers throughout the development process.
          Additionally, full stack developers commonly oversee front end architecture and back end programming; they also perform cross-platform optimization for a variety of digital mediums (desktop, mobile, etc.) Beyond their technical duties, developers are also responsible for collaborative planning in tandem with other company departments; they are also regularly given managerial responsibilities in leading the broader development team.
         </p>

         <p><i>11 Useful Skills & Languages for Full Stack Developers</i><br>
         The full stack developer role hinges on a wide variety of skills — many of which require at least some fluency in different key programming languages. That said, the following are a handful of important skills and languages aspiring full stack developers should learn:
         </p>
         <i><h3>Python</h3></i>
         <p>Since Python is one of the leading programming languages for modern back end web development, it’s equally valuable for those interested in full stack development. The language is favored not only for its versatility, but also for its relative simplicity. In fact, Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey found that Python was the most wanted programming language by a considerable margin, thanks to the fact that it supports many different programming styles and is particularly efficient in data visualization.
            </p>
         <i><h3>JavaScript</h3></i>
         <p>avaScript is another consistently valuable coding skill in full stack development, ranking beneath Python as the second-most desired language amongst Stack Overflow’s surveyed developers. Like Python, JavaScript is regarded for its dynamic array of uses, and in web development, these generally apply to the depth and quality of a web page — namely by allowing developers to make complex style declarations, support high-level math calculations, and reference content from other web pages. Without JavaScript, sites would be more static, less animated, and ultimately less engaging.
            </p>
         <i><h3>HTML</h3></i>
         <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is one of the most widely used coding languages in web development. As a markup language, it refers to the ways in which web pages are linked together and is primarily used to inform a web browser of how to display a web page’s elements via tags. For instance, thetag represents a digital document’s displayed header, potentially containing other tags related to information like a title or relevant link.
            </p>
         <i><h3>CSS</h3></i>
         <p>Along with JavaScript and HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is consistently one of the most-used coding languages in front end development, making it an asset to the full stack role. CSS is primarily used to create an aesthetically pleasing design — specifically the color- and style-based code added to HTML structural elements. For example, a background-color: lightblue element would set the site’s user-facing background to light blue.
            </p>
         <i><h3>SQL</h3></i>
         <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is used in a variety of databases, and it is commonly applied in back end development. The language is mainly used to manage and update records, and access and change databases. Since nearly every website makes use of back end data storage, SQL provides a solid foundation in database-oriented literacy needed in full stack development — especially regarding software built to house sensitive data.
         </p>
         <i><h3>Rust</h3></i>
         <p>Rust is also a highly regarded programming language used in web development, ranking as Stack Overflow’s “most loved” language per its 2020 survey. Rust is commonly used to improve a web page’s speed, parallelism, and inherent memory safety, and it too is valued for its wide range of uses. These include game engine design, operating system construction, and browser component implementation.
         </p>
         <i><h3>Java</h3></i>
         <p>Java tends to rank highly among many top programming language rankings and surveys. This general-purpose language is primarily used in back end web development, and can be applied to a wide variety of different software types. It is imperative for full stack developers to learn languages like Java, as they can be applied to countless scenarios in application construction, maintenance, and conceptualization.
            </p>
         <i><h3>Web Architecture</h3></i>
         <p>Website architecture involves the planning and design of the technical, functional, and visual components of a website (before it is deployed). It’s used by website designers and developers as a means to design and develop a website. Because of this, full stack development goes hand in hand with web architecture — full stack developers must know how back end data is structured to efficiently build a strong cohesive product, and should learn how to separate files and where to perform specific computational tasks.
            </p>
         <i><h3>Critical Thinking</h3></i>
         <p>Web development is nearly synonymous with high-level problem solving — meaning that developers are usually expected to be skilled critical thinkers. A development project can often present an array of challenges, from software limitations to back end bugs, and developers should be prepared to navigate these matters with a comprehensive, solution-oriented mentality, improvising and trying unconventional approaches when necessary. Such thinking not only helps bring a project to fruition, but can also drive the growth of the collective web development team, setting a standard of tenacity and innovation for future projects.
            </p>
         <i><h3>Patience</h3></i>
         <p>Patience comes as a natural companion to critical thinking in web development. Developers should remain calm and proactive (both with themselves and with team cohorts) when troubleshooting and trialing experimental ideas. A solution to a complex issue is not always immediately evident, and a little patience can go a long way in sustaining these efforts and making a breakthrough. This skill is especially important for new developers, as they will often need additional time to find their footing in the industry.
            </p>
         <i><h3>communication</h3></i>
         <p>Communication is another crucial soft skill full stack developers must possess to perform their job well. On any given day, developers may need to coordinate with clients, coders, domain managers, and other internal departments as they navigate their own responsibilities — and since some of these individuals may not be as tech-savvy, clarity and transparency are a must. Web development commonly is a collaborative effort, and honing this mentality can position new full stack developers and their cohorts for lasting success.
            </p>
         <p><i>3 Options for Learning Full Stack Development</i>
         <br>Though full stack development is a high-level,
          <br>multifaceted field,
           <br>aspiring developers can master the knowledge needed without previous experience. 
           What’s more, there are several time-tested educational pathways for those interested in learning full stack skills — these commonly boil down to bootcamp courses, applicable college degrees, and self-taught learning options.
            </p>
         <i><h3>Coding Bootcamps</h3></i>
         <p>Coding bootcamps are among the most effective methods for learning front and back end development skills. These courses offer the chance to learn web development through practical instruction, making use of flexible, intensive curricula to prepare learners for a career in full stack development. No two bootcamps are the same, which is indicative of both their personalization and level of detail in a given concentration.
