        Food is an extremely important source of energy in humans and other
        living organisms. It is vital for the growth and development of the
        body. It helps in performing day to day activities in an efficient way.

        need to survive. Yet some people waste not thinking that there are still
        some people that do not get any of it. We should always be careful while
        taking a meal on our plates. In other words, we should take only that
        much that our stomach can allow. Or else there will be wasting of food.
        In India there are many people living in slums, they do not have proper
        shelter. Moreover, they are not able to have even a one-time meal. They
        starve for days and are always in a state of sickness. Many children are
        there on roads who are laboring to get a daily meal. After seeing
        conditions like these people should not dare to waste food. Moreover, we
        should always provide food to the needy ones as much as we can.
