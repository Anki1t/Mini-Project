        Travelling means going from one place to another in different purposes.
        They also explore to see the unseen and know the unknown. The travellers
        always travel the most beautiful places of the world which uphold the
        existence of nature. All things are created by Allah. There are many
        means to see the unseen and know the unknown, but travelling is the best
        of all. For example: Reading books gives us literal knowledge, listening
        story gives us indefinite ideas, but travelling gives us visual as well
        as concrete knowledge. At the same time, people do not travel in the
        same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone
        travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. There
        are different types of travelling like- travelling by air, bus, boat,
        train, bus etc. Every travelling has much educative value. It is a part
        of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without
        travelling. For this reason, we can learn many things by travelling. It
        teaches us trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture,
        history, geography and so on. Therefore, the educative value of
        travelling beggars description. Besides, there are some special benefits
        of travelling. If a man stays at one place for a long time, he becomes
        monotonous and his life becomes boring and callous. Travelling removes
        our monotony and gives pleasure. Similarly, it also broadens our outlook
        and refreshes our mind. A good traveler can easily educate others. He
        can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of other country. I
        like travelling very much.

        Travelling is a hobby to people. There are people who love to travel
        with friends, with family, with colleagues or even alone. Travelling
        around the globe helps in exploring places. It is also required to
        provide break to self while working for months. It keeps our soul happy
        and relaxed. I believe, travelling once in six months is required for
        every person. It gives break from 9 to 5 job schedule. It is an
        investment that equips a person with practical knowledge. It keeps away
        stress, anxiety and depression. My favourite hobby is travelling.
